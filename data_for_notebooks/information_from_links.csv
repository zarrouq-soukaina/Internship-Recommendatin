In a highly competitive job environment employers want to see that a candidate has the hunger to be successful more than purely in an academic setting.”

In a highly competitive job environment employers want to see that a candidate has the hunger to be successful more than purely in an academic setting.”What do we expect from an Intern?As an Intern we expect you to have?

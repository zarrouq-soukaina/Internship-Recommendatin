## scripts 

This folder consists of all the scripts that allow the app.py to function. All these scripts contain code which is very similar to the code in the jupyter notebooks. The 3 files which are totally new are:

1. knowledge.py - This file contains the code used in app.py to create filters, basically the knowledge based recommendation part of our model.
2. app.py - This is the main app which works via command line. Its pretty cool to use. The details of its usage have been mentioned in the main README file of this project.
3. __init__.py - This file is empty but it's existence allows us to import functions/python files from this folder into others while using python.
